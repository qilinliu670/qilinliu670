			Johann Sebastian Bach (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 - 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the Brandenburg Concertos, the Goldberg Variations, the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which around two hundred survive. His music is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth.
			<br><br>
			Bach's abilities as an organist were highly respected during his lifetime, although he was not widely recognised as a great composer until a revival of interest and performances of his music in the first half of the 19th century. He is now generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time.

			<h2>Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565</h2><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_minor,_BWV_565">
				The Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, is a piece of organ music written, according to its oldest extant sources, by Johann Sebastian Bach. First published in 1833 through the efforts of Felix Mendelssohn, it became the most famous work in the organ repertoire, owing its popularity in part to arrangements such as the one appearing in Walt Disney's Fantasia. Its attribution to Bach has been doubted in the late 20th century and early 21st century, but no edition of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis listed it among the doubtful works, nor does its entry on the website of the Bach Archiv Leipzig even mention such doubts.
				<br><br>
				The composition has been deemed "particularly suited to the organ", and "strikingly unorganistic"; It has been seen as united by a single ground-thought, and as containing "passages which have no connection whatever with the chief idea"; It has been called "entirely a thing of virtuosity" and "not so difficult as it sounds"; It has been described as some sort of program music depicting a storm, and as abstract music, quite the opposite of program music depicting a storm; It has been presented as an emanation of the galant style, yet too dramatic to be anything near that style; Its period of origin has been assumed to have been as early as around 1704, and as late as the 1750s; Its defining characteristics have been associated with extant compositions by Bach (BWV 531, 549a, 578, 911, 914, 922 and several of the solo violin sonatas and partitas), and by others (including Nicolaus Bruhns and Johann Heinrich Buttstett), as well as with untraceable earlier versions for other instruments and/or by other composers; It has been deemed too simplistic for it to have been written down by Bach, and too much a stroke of genius to have been composed by anyone else but Bach.
				<br><br>
				What remains is "the most famous organ work in existence", that in its rise to fame was helped by various arrangements, including bombastic piano settings, versions for full symphonic orchestra, and alternative settings for more modest solo instruments.

			<h2>Fugue in G minor, "Little Fugue"</h2><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue_in_G_minor,_BWV_578">
				Fugue in G minor, BWV 578, "Little" (popularly known as the "Little Fugue"), is a piece of organ music written by Johann Sebastian Bach during his years at Arnstadt (1703 - 1707). It is one of Bach's best known fugues and has been arranged for other voices, including an orchestral version by Leopold Stokowski.
				<br><br>
				Early editors of Bach's work attached this title to distinguish it from the later Great Fantasia and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542, which is longer in duration.
				<br><br>
				The fugue's four-and-a-half measure subject is one of Bach's most recognizable tunes. The fugue is in four voices. During the episodes, Bach uses one of Arcangelo Corelli's most famous techniques: imitation between two voices on an eighth note upbeat figure that first leaps up a fourth and then falls back down one step at a time.

			<h2>Air on the G string</h2><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_on_the_G_String">
				Air on the G String is August Wilhelmj's arrangement of the second movement in Johann Sebastian Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D major, BWV 1068.
				<br><br>
				The arrangement differs from the original in that the part of the first violins is transposed down so that it can be played entirely on a violin's lowest string, i.e. the G string, it is played by a single violin (instead of by the first violins as a group), and that the rest of the music is reduced to an accompaniment that obfuscates most of the detail of the original.
				<br><br>
				Bach's third Orchestral Suite in D major, composed in the first half of the 18th century, has an "Air" as second movement, following its French overture opening movement. The suite is composed for three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, strings (two violin parts and a viola part), and basso continuo. In the second movement of the suite however only the strings and the continuo play. This is the only movement of the suite where all other instruments are silent.
				<br><br>
				The music of the "Air" is written down on four staves, for first violins, second violins, violas, and continuo. The eerie, interweaving melody lines of the high strings contrast with a pronounced rhythmic drive in the bass.
				<br><br>
				In the late 19th century violinist August Wilhelmj arranged the second movement of Bach's third Orchestral Suite for violin and an accompaniment of strings, piano or organ (harmonium). On the score he had "auf der G-Saite" (on the G string) printed above the stave for the solo violin, which gave the arrangement its nickname.
				<br><br>
				In Wilhelmj's version the piece is transposed down from its original key (D major) to C major. Then the part of the first violins is transposed down a further octave and given to a solo violin that can play the entire melody on its lowest string, the G string. The dynamic markings added by Wilhelmj are more in line with a romantic interpretation than with the baroque original.
				<br><br>
				As a violin can't play very loud in its lowest register, all the other parts of Bach's music were firmly reduced in Wilhelmj's version: the keyboard part is to be played staccato and pianissimo, causing the effects of interweaving melodies and of drive in the bass part to go lost. In the strings accompaniment version the violins and violas play muted (con sordino), and the bass part for cellos and double basses is to be played pizzicato and sempre pianissimo, with the same change in effect compared to Bach's original.
				<br><br>
				Later, a spurious story was put about that the melody was always intended to be played on the G string alone. The violin solo part of Wilhelmj's arrangement is sometimes played on the cello. As a result of the popularity of the piece, on the G string remained in the name of various arrangements whether or not a string instrument playing on its G string was involved. Most of these versions have in common that the original melody of the first violins is played in the low register of a solo instrument, accompanied by a reduction of the material of the other parts of Bach's piece, although occasionally versions that stay more in line with Bach's original can go by the same name.
