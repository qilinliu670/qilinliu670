		<h1>Antonin Leopold Dvorak</h2><br>

			Antonin Leopold Dvorak was a Czech composer. After Bedrich Smetana, he was the second Czech composer to achieve worldwide recognition. Following Smetana's nationalist example, Dvorak frequently employed aspects, specifically rhythms, of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia. Dvorak's own style has been described as 'the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them'.
			<br><br>
			Dvorak displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being an apt student of violin playing from age six. The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was age 31. Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area, he first submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany, but he did not win, and the manuscript, not returned, was lost until rediscovered many years later. Then in 1874 he first made a submission for the Austrian State Prize for Composition, including scores of two further symphonies and other works. Brahms, unbeknownst to Dvorak, was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed. The prize was awarded to Dvorak for 1874 and again in 1876 and in 1877, when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick, also a member of the jury, made themselves known to him. Brahms recommended Dvorak to his publisher, Simrock, who soon afterward commissioned what became the Slavonic Dances, Op. 46. These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878, the sheet music (of the original piano 4-hands version) had excellent sales, and Dvorak's international reputation at last was launched.
			<br><br>
			Dvorak's first piece of a religious nature, his setting of Stabat Mater, was premiered in Prague in 1880. It was very successfully performed in London in 1883, leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States. In his career, Dvorak made nine invited visits to England, often conducting performances of his own works. His Seventh Symphony was written for London. Visiting Russia in March 1890, he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In 1891 Dvorak was appointed as a professor at the Prague Conservatory. In 1890-91, he wrote his Dumky Trio, one of his most successful chamber music pieces. In 1892, Dvorak moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City. While in the United States, Dvorak wrote his two most successful orchestral works. The Symphony From the New World spread his reputation worldwide. His Cello Concerto is one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti. Also, he wrote his American String Quartet, his most appreciated piece of chamber music. But shortfalls in payment of his salary, along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness, led him to leave the United States in 1895 and return to Bohemia.
			<br><br>
			Dvorak's nine operas other than his first, Alfred, have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral works. By far the most successful of the operas is Rusalka. Among his smaller works, the seventh Humoresque and the song "Songs My Mother Taught Me" are also widely performed and recorded. He has been described as "arguably the most versatile... composer of his time".

			<h2>Humoresque No. 7, Op. 101</h2><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoresques_(Dvořák)">
				Humoresques (Czech: Humoresky), Op. 101 (B. 187), is a piano cycle by the Czech composer Antonin Dvorak, written during the summer of 1894. One writer says "the seventh Humoresque is probably the most famous small piano work ever written after Beethoven's For Elise."
				<br><br>
				In the United States, Dvorak's Humoresque Number 7 became the setting for a series of mildly scatological humorous verses, regarding passenger train toilets, beginning: "Passengers will please refrain from flushing toilets while the train is standing in the station". The tune together with these words has achieved the status of a "traditional" folk song, often entitled simply "Humoresque". As with all folk art, there are many variations and innumerable verses, often describing troublesome bathroom predicaments and unlikely solutions.

			<h2>Songs My Mother Taught Me</h2><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_My_Mother_Taught_Me_(Dvořák)">
				"Songs My Mother Taught Me" is a song for voice and piano written in 1880 by Antonin Dvorak. It is the fourth of seven songs from his cycle Gypsy Songs, B. 104, Op. 55. The Gypsy Songs are set to poems by Adolf Heyduk in both Czech and German. This song, in particular, has achieved widespread fame.
				<br><br>
				The song has been recorded by a number of well-known singers, including Evan Williams, Gervase Elwes, Nellie Melba, Rosa Ponselle, Jeanette MacDonald, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Victoria de los Angeles, Joan Sutherland, Paul Robeson, Frederica von Stade, Edita Gruberova, Angela Gheorghiu, Magdalena Kozena, and Renee Fleming. The song is also featured on the album Charlotte Church.
				<br><br>
				Fritz Kreisler transcribed the song for violin and piano and performed it frequently. His transcription was first published in 1914. Artists who have recorded instrumental versions of the song include Glenn Miller, Fritz Kreisler, Julian Lloyd Webber, Yo-Yo Ma, Joshua Bell, and Tine Thing Helseth.
				<br><br>
				The title Songs My Mother Taught Me has frequently been used by singers in recitals or on recital discs, even when the song itself is not included in the recording.
