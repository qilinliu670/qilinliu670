			<h1>Johann Pachelbel, "Canon"</h1><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachelbel%27s_Canon">
				Pachelbel's Canon is the name commonly given to a canon by the German Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel in his Canon and Gigue for 3 violins and basso continuo, sometimes referred to as Canon and Gigue in D or simply Canon in D. Neither the date nor the circumstances of its composition are known, and the oldest surviving manuscript copy of the piece dates from the 19th century.
				<br><br>
				Pachelbel's Canon, like Pachelbel's other works, although popular during his lifetime, soon went out of style, and remained in obscurity for centuries thereafter. A 1968 arrangement and recording of it by the Jean-Francois Paillard chamber orchestra became unexpectedly popular over the next decade, and in the 1970s the piece began to be recorded by many ensembles; by the early 1980s its presence as background music was deemed inescapable. From the 1970s to the early 2000s, elements of the piece, especially its chord progression, were used in a variety of pop music songs. Since the 1980s, it has also been used frequently in weddings and funeral ceremonies in the Western world.
				<br><br>
				The canon was originally scored for three violins and basso continuo and paired with a gigue. Both movements are in the key of D major. Although a true canon at the unison in three parts, it also has elements of a chaconne.

			<h1>Jacques Offenbach, "Orpheus in the Underworld"</h1><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus_in_the_Underworld">
				Orpheus in the Underworld is an opera bouffe (a form of operetta), or opera feerie in its revised version. Its score was composed by Jacques Offenbach to a French text written by Ludovic Halevy and later revised by Hector-Jonathan Cremieux.
				<br><br>
				The work, first performed in 1858, is said to be the first classical full-length operetta. Offenbach's earlier operettas were small-scale one-act works, since the law in France did not allow full-length works of certain genres. Orpheus was not only longer, but more musically adventurous than Offenbach's earlier pieces.
				<br><br>
				This also marked the first time that Offenbach used Greek mythology as a background for one of his pieces. The operetta is an irreverent parody and scathing satire on Gluck and his Orfeo ed Euridice and culminates in the risque Galop infernal ("Infernal Galop") that shocked some in the audience at the premiere. Other targets of satire, as would become typical in Offenbach's burlesques, are the stilted performances of classical drama at the Comedie-Francaise and the scandals in society and politics of the Second French Empire.
				<br><br>
				The "Infernal Galop" from Act 2, Scene 2, is famous outside classical circles as the music for the "can-can" (to the extent that the tune is widely, but erroneously, called "can-can"). Saint-Saens borrowed the Galop, slowed it to a crawl, and arranged it for the strings to represent the tortoise in The Carnival of the Animals.

			<h1>Erik Satie, "Gymnopedie No. 1"</h1><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnopédies">
				The Gymnopedies, published in Paris starting in 1888, are three piano compositions written by French composer and pianist Erik Satie.
				<br><br>
				These short, atmospheric pieces are written in 3/4 time, with each sharing a common theme and structure. Collectively, the Gymnopedies are regarded as an important precursor to modern ambient music - gentle yet somewhat eccentric pieces which, when composed, defied the classical tradition. For instance, the first few bars of Gymnopedie No. 1 consist of an alternating progression of two major seventh chords, the first on the subdominant, G, and the second on the tonic, D.
				<br><br>
				The melodies of the pieces use deliberate, but mild, dissonances against the harmony, producing a piquant, melancholy effect that matches the performance instructions, which are to play each piece "painfully", "sadly" or "gravely".
				<br><br>
				From the second half of the 20th century on, the Gymnopedies were often erroneously described as part of Satie's body of furniture music, perhaps because of John Cage's interpretation of them.

			<h1>Claude Debussy, "Clair de lune"</h1><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suite_bergamasque#.22Clair_de_lune.22">
				The Suite bergamasque is one of the most famous piano suites by Claude Debussy. Debussy commenced the suite in 1890 at age 28, but he did not finish or publish it until 1905.
				<br><br>
				The Suite bergamasque was first composed by Debussy around 1890, but was significantly revised just before its publication in 1905. It seems that by the time a publisher came to Debussy in order to cash in on his fame and have these pieces published, Debussy loathed the earlier piano style in which these pieces were written.[1] While it is not known how much of the Suite was written in 1890 and how much was written in 1905, it is clear that Debussy changed the names of at least two of the pieces. "Passepied" was called "Pavane", and "Clair de lune" was originally titled "Promenade Sentimentale." These names also come from Paul Verlaine's poems. The final title of Suite bergamasque comes from Verlaine's poem Clair de Lune, which refers to 'bergamasques' in its opening stanza.
				<br><br>
				The third and most famous movement of Suite bergamasque is "Clair de lune," the French term for "moon light". Its name comes from Verlaine's poem of the same name. It is written in the uncommon 9/8 meter.
				<br><br>
				"Clair de lune" has been arranged for a wide variety of instrumental combinations. One such is Dimitri Tiomkin's arrangement for organ in the score for the 1956 film Giant.

			<h1>Aram Khachaturian, "Sabre Dance"</h1>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre_Dance">
				The "Sabre Dance" is a movement in the final act of Aram Khachaturian's ballet Gayane (1942), "where the dancers display their skill with sabres." It is Khachaturian's best known and most recognizable work. Its middle section is based on an Armenian folk song. According to Tigran Mansurian, it is a synthesis of an Armenian wedding dance tune from Gyumri tied in a saxophone counterpoint "that seems to come straight from America."
				<br><br>
				In 1948 the "Sabre Dance" became a jukebox hit in the United States. Due to its popularity, Newsweek suggested that 1948 could be called "Khachaturian Year in the United States." In that year, three versions of the "Sabre Dance" (one played by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Artur Rodzinski; another one by the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Efrem Kurtz; and by Oscar Levant) reached number one in the Billboard Best-Selling Records by Classical Artists. These three versions were included in the Year's Top Selling Classical Artists by Billboard in 1948. The "Sabre Dance" became the first million-selling record of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. According to the Current Biography Yearbook, it was Levant's performance that "received popular attention."
				<br><br>
				The piece "has entered the realm of popular music as one of the 20th century's signature pieces." It was further made popular by covers by pop artists, first in the US and later in other countries, such as the UK and Germany. Its use in a wide range of films and TV series over the decades have significantly contributed to its renown. The "Sabre Dance" has also been used by a number of figure skaters. Tom Huizenga of NPR describes it as "one of the catchiest, most familiar - perhaps most maddening - tunes to come out of the 20th century." Billboard magazine calls it "a piece that's known to every pops orchestra in existence."

			<h1>Frederic Chopin, "Revolutionary Etude"</h1><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Étude_Op._10,_No._12_(Chopin)">
				Etude Op. 10, No. 12 in C minor, known as the Revolutionary Etude or the Etude on the Bombardment of Warsaw, is a solo piano work by Frederic Chopin written circa 1831, and the last in his first set, Etudes Op.10, dedicated "a son ami Franz Liszt" ("to his friend Franz Liszt").
				<br><br>
				The 12th Etude appeared around the same time as the November Uprising in 1831. Chopin poured his emotions on the matter into many pieces that he composed at that time, the "Revolutionary Etude" standing out as the most notable example. Upon conclusion of Poland's failed revolution against Russia, he cried "All this has caused me much pain. Who could have foreseen it!"
				<br><br>
				Unlike etudes of prior periods (works designed to emphasize and develop particular aspects of musical technique), the romantic etudes of composers such as Chopin and Liszt are fully developed musical concert pieces, but still continue to represent a goal of developing stronger technique.
				<br><br>
				The end of the 12th Etude alludes to Beethoven's last piano sonata, written in the same key-a piece Chopin is known to have greatly admired (compare bars 77-81 in the Etude to bars 150-152 in the first movement (also ending in C major) of Beethoven's sonata.

			<h1>Felix Mendelssohn, "Violin Concerto in E minor"</h1><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_Concerto_(Mendelssohn)">
				Felix Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64, is his last large orchestral work. It forms an important part of the violin repertoire and is one of the most popular and most frequently performed violin concertos of all time. A typical performance lasts just under half an hour.
				<br><br>
				Mendelssohn originally proposed the idea of the violin concerto to Ferdinand David, a close friend and then concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Although conceived in 1838, the work took another six years to complete and was not premiered until 1845. During this time, Mendelssohn maintained a regular correspondence with David, who gave him many suggestions. The work itself was one of the foremost violin concertos of the Romantic era and was influential on many other composers.
				<br><br>
				Although the concerto consists of three movements in a standard fast-slow-fast structure and each movement follows a traditional form, the concerto was innovative and included many novel features for its time. Distinctive aspects include the almost immediate entrance of the violin at the beginning of the work (rather than following an orchestral preview of the first movement's major themes, as was typical in Classical-era concertos) and the through-composed form of the concerto as a whole, in which the three movements are melodically and harmonically connected and played attacca (each movement immediately following the previous one).
				<br><br>
				The concerto was well received and soon became regarded as one of the greatest violin concertos of all time. The concerto remains popular to this day and has developed a reputation as an essential concerto for all aspiring concert violinists to master, and usually one of the first Romantic era concertos they learn. Many professional violinists have recorded the concerto and the work is regularly performed in concerts and classical music competitions.
				<br><br>
				Instead of an orchestral tutti, the concerto opens with the almost immediate entry of the solo violin, playing the very tune in E minor that gave Mendelssohn no peace. Following a bravura of rapidly ascending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra. There is then a frenetic chromatic transition passage as the music subsides and modulates into a tranquil second subject theme in G major. The melody is initially played by the woodwinds with the soloist providing a pedal note on an open G string. The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short codetta ends the exposition section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the development section, where the music builds up to the innovative cadenza, which Mendelssohn wrote out in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise. The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from quavers to quaver-triplets and finally to semiquavers, which require ricochet bowing from the soloist. This serves as a link to the recapitulation, where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the E major before returning to E minor for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked 'Presto', before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.

			<h1>George Frideric Handel, "Lascia ch'io pianga"</h1><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascia_ch%27io_pianga">
				"Lascia ch'io pianga" is an Italian-language soprano aria by composer George Frideric Handel which has become a popular concert piece.
				<br><br>
				The original melody for the aria is first found in Act III of Handel's 1705 opera Almira as a Sarabande. The score for this can be seen on page 81 of Vol. 55 of Chrysander.
				<br><br>
				Three years later, Handel re-cycled the melody and used it for an aria for the character Piacere in the second part of his 1707 oratorio Il trionfo del tempo e del disinganno. This version of the aria is entitled, "Lascia la spina". Chrysander's score for this aria can be seen on page 76 of Vol. 24.
				<br><br>
				The text and lyrics for this version of the aria are as follows:
				<br><br>
				Leave the thorn, take the rose; you go searching for your pain.
				<br><br>
				Gray frost by hidden hand will come when you heart doesn't expect it.
				<br><br>
				In 1711, Handel recycled the music yet again, this time for his 1711 London opera Rinaldo, using a new text and giving the aria to the character Almirena (portrayed by soprano Isabella Girardeau in the opera's premiere) in act 2. Rinaldo was a major triumph for Handel, and it is with this work that the aria is chiefly associated.
				<br><br>
				Handel's 1739 pasticcio Giove in Argo also features a shorter and lesser known "Lascia la spina".

			<h1>Modest Mussorgsky, "Pictures at an Exibition - Promenade"</h1><br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictures_at_an_Exhibition#Promenade_2">
				Pictures at an Exhibition is a suite in ten movements (plus a recurring, varied Promenade) composed for the piano by Russian composer Modest Mussorgsky in 1874.
				<br><br>
				The suite is Mussorgsky's most famous piano composition and has become a showpiece for virtuoso pianists. It has become further known through various orchestrations and arrangements produced by other musicians and composers, with Maurice Ravel's arrangement being the most recorded and performed.
				<br><br>
				Vladimir Stasov's program, identified below, and the six known extant pictures suggest that the ten pieces comprising the suite correspond to eleven pictures by Hartmann, with Samuel Goldenberg und Schmuyle accounting for two. The five Promenade movements, consisting of an introduction and four links, are not numbered among the ten pictures. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Promenade movements are untitled in the composer's manuscript.
				<br><br>
				The Promenade theme provides distinctive "cells" of two and three notes that generate themes and accompaniment figures throughout the piece. In this piece Mussorgsky depicts himself "roving through the exhibition, now leisurely, now briskly in order to come close to a picture that had attracted his attention, and at times sadly, thinking of his departed friend." The melody and rhythm resemble Russian folk songs. The piece has simple, strong rhythms in asymmetrical meter.
